CBO - Coupling between objects
LCOM - Lack of Cohesion of Methods
CBO is a metric that measures the number of classes to which a class is coupled with. Measures how reusable, maintainable, and testable 
a class is.

High cohesion within a class and low coupling between classes are features of good SOFTWARE design. However, it can also be a 
reflective indicator of good OBJECT-ORIENTED design
